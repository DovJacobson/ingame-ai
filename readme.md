# In-Game AI Workshop

Welcome! This repo will help us learn, build and share our AI-inhabited games.
We use Twine, OpenAI and GitHub: No prior experience needed.

## What we'll do:

1. **Play my sample game**  
   [Open miss-behavior.html](https://dovjacobson.github.io/ingame-ai/miss-behavior.html).

2. **Download the sample game and open it Twine**  
   - [Open the raw file: miss-behavior.html](https://github.com/DovJacobson/ingame-ai/blob/main/miss-behavior.html) 
   - <span title="Download">ðŸ“¥</span> Save it on your device - perhaps in your Downloads folder.
   - Go to [twinery.org](https://twinery.org/).
   - Choose **Use in the Browser**
   - **Skip** Intro, then click **Library** then **Import** to load the game from your folder.
  
   - First - we will study how it works,
   - Then you and your team hack my game to pieces and build your own. 
That's the bulk of our workshop! 

3. **Publish your own game**  
   - In Twine, use **Publish to File** (not Save) to export your game to the device filesystem.
   - Name your file with your team name, eg: `dreamers-guild.html`.
   - Log in to GitHub with your own account.
     -  If you donâ€™t have your own account, you can use our shared account
        - username: `ingame-ai`
        - password: a five-word (lower case) phrase that Iâ€™ll share. "xxx xx xxxx xxxx xxx".
   - Upload your game file to this repo.
   - For the commit message, use your gameâ€™s title or a short description (for example: `Find Your Desk (an onboarding game)`).

4. **Play games made by others**  
   Head to the [Workshop Games page](https://dovjacobson.github.io/ingame-ai/) to see and play all the games created during the workshop.

## Notes

- **Decency** I will delete anything that feels hurtful.
- **AI access is temporary.** The AI features work because Iâ€™m sharing my OpenAI API key {hidden behind a proxy). It'll work for a few days so you can share with friends, then Iâ€™ll disable it before your game goes viral!!  To keep your game alive, get your own openai account and set up your own key.
