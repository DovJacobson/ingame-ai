# In-Game AI Workshop

Welcome! This repository supports the **In-Game AI Workshop**, where you create your own AI-powered characters and stories in a game using Twine and a simple OpenAI API. Don’t worry if you’ve never used GitHub before—you’ll get friendly, step-by-step help throughout the workshop.

## What can you do here?

You’ll use this repository to:

1. **Play the sample game**  
   Open [miss-behavior.html](https://dovjacobson.github.io/ingame-ai/miss-behavior.html) directly in your browser.

2. **Download the sample game and edit it in Twine**  
   - Download `miss-behavior.html` to your computer.
   - Open [twinery.org](https://twinery.org/) in your browser.
   - Use Twine’s “Import From File” to bring in the game.
   - Edit and experiment as much as you like!

3. **Publish your own game**  
   - When you’re ready, use Twine’s **Publish to File** option (not just Save) to export your game as an HTML file.
   - Name your file with your team name (for example, `team-unicorn.html`). This keeps everyone’s work unique!
   - Upload your file to this GitHub repository.  
     - During the workshop, you’ll log in as the user `ingame-ai` (the password will be provided in person).
     - Use your team name as the commit message.
   - Once uploaded, your game will be playable online and shared with other participants.

4. **Play games made by others**  
   Visit the [Workshop Games page](https://dovjacobson.github.io/ingame-ai/) to see and play all the games created during the workshop.

## Important Notes

- **Be kind.** If you upload anything hateful or inappropriate, it will be removed.
- **OpenAI API access is temporary.** The AI features in your games work thanks to a shared OpenAI API key that’s hidden behind a secure proxy. This will be available for a few days after the workshop, but will be disabled soon after. If you want to keep sharing your game, you’ll need to set up your own API key later.
- You can always ask questions—no experience required!
